# Course Site Frontend

This is the React frontend for the Course Site application.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm must be installed on your system

### Setup
1. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd server-nodejs
   npm install
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd course-site
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. You can set these in several ways:

```
# Create a .env file with REACT_APP_API_URL=http://your-server-address:port
# Or set the environment variable when starting: REACT_APP_API_URL=http://your-server-address:port npm start
```

### Option 1: Create a .env file

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://your-api-domain:port
```

### Option 2: Set environment variables when starting the app

```bash
# For development
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://your-api-domain:port npm start

# For production build
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://your-api-domain:port npm run build
```

### Option 3: Set environment variables on your hosting platform

Most hosting platforms (Vercel, Netlify, etc.) allow you to set environment variables in their dashboard.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.



### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Default Configuration

If no API URL is specified, the application will default to `http://localhost:5001`.
